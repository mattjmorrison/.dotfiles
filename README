These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine. 

My dotfiles are my best friend. They are my life. I must master them as I must
 master my life.

My dotfiles, without me, are useless. Without my dotifiles, I am useless.

Make my dotfiles yours by cloning my repo (don't forget the submodules)

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/mattjmorrison/.dotfiles.git
